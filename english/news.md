## One

1.  Trump threatens to use brute force to lower prices

With many Americans frustrated over the high cost of living, the president has embraced a strategy of brute force. He has pressured the Federal Reserve in an effort to make mortgages more attractive, demanded credit card companies lower their fees and lashed out at businesses over high costs, among other threats. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher than a year ago, according to the latest data, and food prices climbed sharply last month.

1.  Donald Trump urged protesters in Iran to "TAKE OVER" state institutions, saying that "HELP IS ON ITS WAY" as nationwide protests continued. He said all meetings with Iranian representatives would be cancelled until the killings stopped. An Iranian official estimated that around 2,000 people have died since the demonstrations erupted in late December, according to Reuters, a news agency.

1.  Prosecutors resign over Justice Dept.'s response to ICE shooting

Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned today over the Trump administration's push to investigate the widow of the woman an ICE agent killed last week in Minneapolis. They also objected to the Justice Department's reluctance to investigate the shooter.

## One

1.  What's the best activity for longevity?

Research has repeatedly shown that regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to lengthen your life. Even just a few minutes a day has real benefits. However, some activities seem to come with extra benefits. In particular, tennis has been linked with longevity. One study found that tennis players lived almost 10 years longer than their sedentary peers — and longer than soccer players, cyclists and swimmers. That may be because tennis is a full-body workout that often involves socializing and can be played later in life.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, he threatened a 10% levy on all goods starting on February 1st, increasing to 25% on June 1st. His threats followed mass protests in Denmark and Greenland in response to America's push to acquire the Arctic territory.

## One

1.  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney used a major address in Davos to urge world leaders to see the reality of a world that's increasingly governed by superpower aggression. Recent events have shown the "rules-based international order" is effectively dead, Carney said, which means Canada and other countries have no choice but to create new alliances to oppose pressure tactics and intimidation.

1.  Fewer people are jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge

The Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic span that hangs between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, has been the site of more than 2,000 confirmed suicide leaps since it opened in 1937. For decades, the death toll hovered around 30 a year. But now, after the completion of a $224 million project to install stainless-steel nets below the bridge, the number of suicides has noticeably dropped. There were none in the second half of 2025.

1.  After deadly train crash, investigators focus on the track

Spanish authorities struggled today to identify those killed in Sunday's high-speed train collision, which left at least 41 people dead. Investigators there are focusing on whether a track problem may have caused the incident, and a train undercarriage found in a stream may be a clue.

## One

1.  Federal immigration agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis. Video of the incident shows several agents wrestling the man to the ground before he was shot multiple times. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the victim had a gun and resisted attempts to disarm him. This was the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, called on the Trump administration to end its immigration crackdown in the city.

1.  A winter storm expected to be the largest of the season is already causing major disruptions across the US, with airlines cutting more than 2,300 flights. The storm is expected to span nearly 1,500 miles, bringing heavy snow, crippling ice and subzero wind chill to some of the biggest US cities, threatening power outages for much of the nation. Heavy snow will likely start falling across New York City early Sunday, with more than 14 inches possible throughout the metro area before the storm subsides late Monday.

Kirk Milhoan, a doctor who leads the federal panel that recommends vaccines for Americans, said this week that shots protecting against polio and measles — and perhaps all diseases — should be optional. The polio and measles vaccines are widely credited with preventing millions of deaths, and many public health experts strongly disagree with Milhoan.

1.  Yale will offer free tuition to undergraduates from families making less than $200,000. The changes, which take effect in the 2026-2027 academic year, will also eliminate all expected costs for families with typical assets and incomes below $100,000. The decision matches a move by Harvard University last year to broaden educational affordability.


## Two

1.  Trump faults Pretti for carrying a gun

Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the president promised a "very honorable and honest investigation" into the killing of Alex Pretti, who was shot dead over the weekend by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump also cast blame on Pretti for carrying the legally permitted weapon that was seized from him before he was shot. "You can't walk in with guns," the president said. "You can't do that."

1.  Are social media apps addictive like cigarettes? Do they harm young users?

Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube will be forced to confront such questions in a series of landmark trials. The first began today in California, where a young woman said she had become addicted to the sites as a child and had experienced anxiety and depression as a result. TikTok and Snap settled the case, but they remain defendants in more than a dozen others, which may result in huge monetary payments or changes to the platforms.

1.  Kevin Warsh has been preparing to lead the Fed for more than a decade.

He thought he had the job in 2017, but President Trump had doubts. Today, however, the president announced that he would nominate the 55-year-old former Fed official to chair the central bank. If confirmed by the Senate, Warsh would succeed Jerome Powell in mid-May. Wall Street has conflicting views on Warsh, as reflected in falling stocks, steady bond yields, a rallying dollar and the worst day for gold and silver in more than four decades.

1.  Genes may determine longevity, no matter your health choices

Researchers used data from thousands of twins, who share identical genes, to conclude that aging is mostly hereditary. You can lengthen it a bit, the new study suggests: One of the researchers calculated that healthy or unhealthy habits can add or subtract five years or so from a life expectancy. But if your genetic potential is to live to be 80, for example, it is unlikely that anything you do will push your age at death up to 100.

In Germany, it is second nature for people to open their windows a few times each day to cycle out stale air. They call the practice "lüften," which roughly translates to "ventilate" or "air out." In recent weeks, lüften has gained traction with Americans, who have flooded social media with videos referring to the practice as "house burping. Unlike many online trends, there are real benefits: Experts say that opening windows can help clean the air and reduce mold.

1.  Former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will appear before a congressional committee investigating disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. A full House vote had been planned this week to hold the Clintons in criminal contempt if they continued to defy subpoenas in its Epstein inquiry.

Some Epstein associates - British power broker Peter Mandelson, Norwegian royal Mette-Marit, celebrity doctor Peter Attia - are paying real reputational and professional costs. The Epstein files are being consumed in an information ecosystem that struggles with nuance, context and legal standards — where guilt by association is the default. Al compounds the confusion: Fake emails, doctored screenshots and Al-generated images circulate alongside authentic ones, tricking even veteran journalists.

## One

1.  President Trump posted a video on his social media site last night that included a blatantly racist portrayal of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The clip was loudly condemned by many of the president's critics and even some of his allies.

But after hours of criticism, Trump deleted the video from his account.

1.  Car insurance prices dipped last year after a post-pandemic stretch of skyrocketing costs, Alex Fitzpatrick writes from a new Insurify report. The average annual full-coverage premium fell 6% nationally from 2024 to 2025, to $2,144. That relief comes after costs rose nearly 50% from 2022 to 2024, "partially due to risky driving behavior following the pandemic," the insurance-comparison platform says.

1.  Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, announced today that Canada would offer automakers billions of dollars in incentives and tax breaks aimed at turning the country into a global leader in electric vehicles. The plan was designed to make the country less reliant on the U.S., where Trump has made it clear that he does not want Americans driving cars made in Canada. Carney also agreed last month to allow a small number of Chinese E.V.s into the Canadian market at a low tariff rate, which could cut into U.S. automaker sales.

1.  If you think your daily doses of espresso or Earl Grey sharpen your mind, you just might be right. A large new study shows evidence of cognitive benefits from coffee and tea - as long as they're caffeinated. Participants who drank two to three cups of coffee, or one to two cups of tea, daily for decades had a lower chance of developing dementia than people who drank little or no caffeine, the researchers reported.

1.  Trump called a U.S. skier at the Winter Olympics "a real loser." After Hunter Hess said he felt "mixed emotions" about representing the U.S. and that wearing the flag didn't mean endorsing "everything that's going on" at home, Trump claimed Hess "doesn't represent his Country" and said it's "very hard to root" for him. JD Vance, meanwhile, was booed after appearing on stadium screens during the opening ceremony.

1.  In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing huge pressure on his leadership. A crisis over the appointment of Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the US, despite ties to Jeffrey Epstein, is intensifying and now Starmer's top aide has quit, along with his head of communications.

1.  Takaichi emerged Sunday from a snap election with a historic majority that arguably gives her a mandate for a more assertive foreign policy. Chinese leaders must now decide whether to maintain economic pressure on Tokyo, or find an off-ramp.

## One

1.  Drones and other tech advances are reshaping how viewers experience the Winter Olympics. New camera angles can pull the audience into the athlete's perspective, making the sheer intensity and speed of events like skiing and bobsled easier to grasp. One of the most obvious tech advances at this year's games has been the extensive use of drones by the Olympic Broadcasting Services, the group that provides camera feeds to NBC and other broadcasters. OBS has more than two dozen drones in use for these Olympics, with the flying cameras being used indoors and outdoors - basically at all sports other than ice hockey and curling.

## Two

1.  America's secretary of state received a standing ovation at the Munich Security Conference. Marco Rubio said "the United States and Europe belong together", emphasising the Western allies' common civilisational bonds (while criticising Europe's deindustrialisation and mass migration). His message is being widely seen as an attempt to mend the damage done to the relationship at last year's conference by the speech of America's vice-president J.D. Vance.


## Three

1.  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was reassured by Mr Rubio's words, but noted that "some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed". She also stated that "Europe has no other choice but to become independent". Britain's prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, admitted that America's security umbrella had allowed Europe to develop bad habits, but added "we must break them"
