## One

1.  Trump threatens to use brute force to lower prices

With many Americans frustrated over the high cost of living, the president has embraced a strategy of brute force. He has pressured the Federal Reserve in an effort to make mortgages more attractive, demanded credit card companies lower their fees and lashed out at businesses over high costs, among other threats. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher than a year ago, according to the latest data, and food prices climbed sharply last month.

1.  Donald Trump urged protesters in Iran to "TAKE OVER" state institutions, saying that "HELP IS ON ITS WAY" as nationwide protests continued. He said all meetings with Iranian representatives would be cancelled until the killings stopped. An Iranian official estimated that around 2,000 people have died since the demonstrations erupted in late December, according to Reuters, a news agency.

1.  Prosecutors resign over Justice Dept.'s response to ICE shooting

Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned today over the Trump administration's push to investigate the widow of the woman an ICE agent killed last week in Minneapolis. They also objected to the Justice Department's reluctance to investigate the shooter.

## One

1.  What's the best activity for longevity?

Research has repeatedly shown that regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to lengthen your life. Even just a few minutes a day has real benefits. However, some activities seem to come with extra benefits. In particular, tennis has been linked with longevity. One study found that tennis players lived almost 10 years longer than their sedentary peers — and longer than soccer players, cyclists and swimmers. That may be because tennis is a full-body workout that often involves socializing and can be played later in life.

1.  Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said she "presented" President Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize during an Oval Office meeting yesterday. Trump, who has publicly campaigned for the prize, wrote on Truth Social: "María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect."

1.  Donald Trump announced that he would impose escalating tarifis on Denmark and other European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, that fail to support his bid to purchase Greenland. Writing on his Truth Social platform, he threatened a 10% levy on all goods starting on February 1st, increasing to 25% on June 1st. His threats followed mass protests in Denmark and Greenland in response to America's push to acquire the Arctic territory.

## One

1.  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney used a major address in Davos to urge world leaders to see the reality of a world that's increasingly governed by superpower aggression. Recent events have shown the "rules-based international order" is effectively dead, Carney said, which means Canada and other countries have no choice but to create new alliances to oppose pressure tactics and intimidation.

1.  Fewer people are jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge

The Golden Gate Bridge, the iconic span that hangs between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, has been the site of more than 2,000 confirmed suicide leaps since it opened in 1937. For decades, the death toll hovered around 30 a year. But now, after the completion of a $224 million project to install stainless-steel nets below the bridge, the number of suicides has noticeably dropped. There were none in the second half of 2025.

1.  After deadly train crash, investigators focus on the track

Spanish authorities struggled today to identify those killed in Sunday's high-speed train collision, which left at least 41 people dead. Investigators there are focusing on whether a track problem may have caused the incident, and a train undercarriage found in a stream may be a clue.

## One

1.  Federal immigration agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis. Video of the incident shows several agents wrestling the man to the ground before he was shot multiple times. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the victim had a gun and resisted attempts to disarm him. This was the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month. Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, called on the Trump administration to end its immigration crackdown in the city.

1.  A winter storm expected to be the largest of the season is already causing major disruptions across the US, with airlines cutting more than 2,300 flights. The storm is expected to span nearly 1,500 miles, bringing heavy snow, crippling ice and subzero wind chill to some of the biggest US cities, threatening power outages for much of the nation. Heavy snow will likely start falling across New York City early Sunday, with more than 14 inches possible throughout the metro area before the storm subsides late Monday.

1.  Vaccine panel chair says shots should be optiona!

Kirk Milhoan, a doctor who leads the federal panel that recommends vaccines for Americans, said this week that shots protecting against polio and measles — and perhaps all diseases — should be optional. The polio and measles vaccines are widely credited with preventing millions of deaths, and many public health experts strongly disagree with Milhoan.

## One

1.  Yale will offer free tuition to undergraduates from families making less than $200,000. The changes, which take effect in the 2026-2027 academic year, will also eliminate all expected costs for families with typical assets and incomes below $100,000. The decision matches a move by Harvard University last year to broaden educational affordability.


## Two

1.  Trump faults Pretti for carrying a gun

Speaking to reporters this afternoon, the president promised a "very honorable and honest investigation" into the killing of Alex Pretti, who was shot dead over the weekend by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump also cast blame on Pretti for carrying the legally permitted weapon that was seized from him before he was shot. "You can't walk in with guns," the president said. "You can't do that."

1.  Are social media apps addictive like cigarettes? Do they harm young users?

Meta, Snap, TikTok and YouTube will be forced to confront such questions in a series of landmark trials. The first began today in California, where a young woman said she had become addicted to the sites as a child and had experienced anxiety and depression as a result. TikTok and Snap settled the case, but they remain defendants in more than a dozen others, which may result in huge monetary payments or changes to the platforms.
