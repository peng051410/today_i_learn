## One

1.  Trump threatens to use brute force to lower prices

With many Americans frustrated over the high cost of living, the president has embraced a strategy of brute force. He has pressured the Federal Reserve in an effort to make mortgages more attractive, demanded credit card companies lower their fees and lashed out at businesses over high costs, among other threats. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher than a year ago, according to the latest data, and food prices climbed sharply last month.

## Two

1.  Donald Trump urged protesters in Iran to "TAKE OVER" state institutions, saying that "HELP IS ON ITS WAY" as nationwide protests continued. He said all meetings with Iranian representatives would be cancelled until the killings stopped. An Iranian official estimated that around 2,000 people have died since the demonstrations erupted in late December, according to Reuters, a news agency.

## One

1.  What's the best activity for longevity?

Research has repeatedly shown that regular exercise is one of the most effective ways to lengthen your life. Even just a few minutes a day has real benefits. However, some activities seem to come with extra benefits. In particular, tennis has been linked with longevity. One study found that tennis players lived almost 10 years longer than their sedentary peers — and longer than soccer players, cyclists and swimmers. That may be because tennis is a full-body workout that often involves socializing and can be played later in life.

## Three

1.  Donald Trump announced that he would impose escalating tarifis on Denmark and other European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, that fail to support his bid to purchase Greenland. Writing on his Truth Social platform, he threatened a 10% levy on all goods starting on February 1st, increasing to 25% on June 1st. His threats followed mass protests in Denmark and Greenland in response to America's push to acquire the Arctic territory.
