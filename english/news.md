1, Judges rejected TikTok's effort to avoid a U.S. ban
TikTok, a video app used by more than 170 million Americans,
moved one step closer today to disappearing from the U.S. market. A
panel of federal judges unanimously upheld a new law that requires
the app's Chinese owner to either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner
by mid-January or face a nationwide ban in the U.S. While Donald
Trump has promised to save the app, the law is set to go into effect
the day before his inauguration and it's unclear how he could evade
an act of Congress and whether he wants to risk much political
capital on this given his hawkish stance on China.

1.  N.Y.P.D. said the shooting suspect may have left the city

New York's police commissioner said today that the man who
fatally shot a health insurance executive in Midtown
Manhattan might have left the city. The authorities said they
have video of the man taking a cab to an interstate bus station
in Upper Manhattan and entering it on the day of the attack,
but never exiting. So far, there have been no arrests and the
authorities have not established a motive.

1.  Suspect in C.E.O. killing is fighting extradition

The 26-year-old man who was charged with murder in the assassination of a
health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan was denied bail today.
Mangione saw himself as a hero fighting a corrupt health insurance industry,
the authorities said in an internal report obtained by The Times. The police
also expressed concern that the attack could inspire violence against similar
executives or other extreme behavior.
Here's what we know about the suspect: Mangione was a high school
valedictorian and an Ivy League tech graduate from a prominent Maryland
family. The subject of a missing-person report filed in San Francisco by his
mother last month, he had stopped communicating with friends and family
about six months ago.

1.  Trump had his perfect 1980s day. He rang the bell to open the

stock exchange and was named Person of the Year by Time magazine.
Trump, speaking with Time, pledged to start pardoning Jan. 6 rioters
once he enters office. He sounded open to banning some childhood
vaccines and reversing protections for transgender kids. During the
campaign, Trump said he'd lower grocery prices. Yesterday, he told
Time that "it's hard to bring things down once they're up," but he
added that he was still hopeful.

Mexico to India has sapped supply, pushed up prices and-worst

chili peppers and other crops are becoming harder to find as
climate change increases the frequency of weather extremes such
as drought and floods, according to researchers. Some suppliers
are under pressure and chefs will soon be forced to innovate.

1.  Mangione Faces First-Degree Murder Charge That Brands Him a Terrorist

A grand jury formally indicted Luigi Mangione in the killing of Brian
Thompson, the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare. "This was a frightening,
well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention
and intimidation, " said Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, at a
news conference on Tuesday. A lawyer for Mr. Mangione, Karen Friedman
Agnifilo, declined to comment on the new charges. If convicted on the highest
charges, Mr. Mangione faces a sentence of life in prison without parole.

1.  Hopes were high that the Fed's rate cuts could make homes

more affordable, but so far, that hasn't happened. Average rates
on 30-year mortgages have climbed to around 6.7% from
roughly 6.1% since the central bank started lowering rates in
September, according to Freddie Mac. And they're only poised
to rise further. That's because mortgage rates move with the
yield on the 10-year Treasury, which has surged this week.

1, American Airlines briefly grounded all U.S. flights
On one of the busiest travel days of the year, American Airlines grounded all
its flights in the U.S. this morning for about an hour. American said a vendor
technology issue had affected systems needed to release flights. While
relatively brief, the ground stop could result in heavy delays in the coming
days. Tens of millions of people fly from mid-December to shortly after New
Year's Day, and a travel record is expected to be set this year. The airline
issued a waiver allowing people flying through some airports to reschedule
their flights through Thursday.
