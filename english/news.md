1, Judges rejected TikTok's effort to avoid a U.S. ban
TikTok, a video app used by more than 170 million Americans,
moved one step closer today to disappearing from the U.S. market. A
panel of federal judges unanimously upheld a new law that requires
the app's Chinese owner to either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner
by mid-January or face a nationwide ban in the U.S. While Donald
Trump has promised to save the app, the law is set to go into effect
the day before his inauguration and it's unclear how he could evade
an act of Congress and whether he wants to risk much political
capital on this given his hawkish stance on China.

New York's police commissioner said today that the man who
fatally shot a health insurance executive in Midtown
Manhattan might have left the city. The authorities said they
have video of the man taking a cab to an interstate bus station
in Upper Manhattan and entering it on the day of the attack,
but never exiting. So far, there have been no arrests and the
authorities have not established a motive.

1.  Suspect in C.E.O. killing is fighting extradition

The 26-year-old man who was charged with murder in the assassination of a
health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan was denied bail today.
Mangione saw himself as a hero fighting a corrupt health insurance industry,
the authorities said in an internal report obtained by The Times. The police
also expressed concern that the attack could inspire violence against similar
executives or other extreme behavior.
Here's what we know about the suspect: Mangione was a high school
valedictorian and an Ivy League tech graduate from a prominent Maryland
family. The subject of a missing-person report filed in San Francisco by his
mother last month, he had stopped communicating with friends and family
about six months ago.

cancer, the US's top doctor said. Evidence of links between drinking and cancer
has been rising for decades, yet fewer than half of Americans recognize that it

Murthy said Friday. Alcohol causes about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000
related deaths each year in the US, far more than the 13,500 alcohol-associated
annual traffic fatalities. Adding a cancer warning would highlight severe health
concerns for products that more than 70% of US adults consume at least once a

1.  Get ready for Super Bowl Sunday

We're just two days away from America's biggest annual sporting event, the
Super Bowl. Kansas City and Philadelphia will meet at New Orleans's famous
Superdome, where Kansas City is narrowly favored to win its third consecutive
title. Kendrick Lamar will headline the halftime show, President Trump is

1.  How to sanitize your kitchen sink

After the effort of cooking a meal and clearing a sink full of dishes, cleaning
the sink itself may be the last thing you want to do. Unfortunately, it's
important: It kills pathogens from produce and raw meat, and it helps keep the
kitchen from getting smelly. Luckily, cleaning your sink can be an easy, two-
step process. Scrub off grime with a bit of dish soap on a brush or sponge and
then rinse the sink down. Next, sanitize it with a spray containing bleach,
making sure to cover the faucets and handles. Let the spray sit for the
recommended time, rinse with water, and voilà.

companies from bribing foreign officials to win business. The
measure disadvantages U.S. firms because they can't do what
overseas rivals do, and excessive enforcement crimps the president's

Shares of the conglomerate that sold a controlling stake in Panama ports slumped in Asia after China's top office on Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper's sharp attack on the decision. The company, owned by one of Hong Kong's highest-profile billionaires, was guilty of "spineless groveling" and "selling out all Chinese people."

The SpaceX capsule is expected to fall to Earth (there will be parachutes), splashing down off the Florida coast around 6 p.m. local time. The lengthy sojourn will have made them taller, weaker and maybe given them vision trouble, according to medical studies of previous astronauts.

The average wholesale price of a dozen eggs was $3 yesterday, down 63% from a record $8.15 in the Feb. 21 report. Retail prices, which typically trail wholesale, are beginning to fall as well. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned that the Easter season has "the highest price for eggs" and prices could "inch back up."

1, From friend, to foe, Donald Trump's latest trade salvo impacts just about everyone. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that price increases and weaker economic growth are more likely than they seemed a few weeks ago as tariffs were raised more than expected. Powell added that it was too early to discuss interest rate adjustments. For now, Americans worried about rising prices are stocking up on televisions, soy sauce and Lululemon gear, while the rest of the world is bracing for an influx of cheap Chinese goods. And people in remote parts of the globe are wondering how they got on the tariff list.

The International Civil Aviation Organization - the UN body that crafts airline policy and that the FAA takes cues from — is considering the biggest shake-up to air travel in 50 years, The Times of London reports. Under the new rules, passengers will be issued a "journey pass" when they book a flight, which will be continually updated with changes and replace the boarding pass. Passengers also will be able to upload their passports to their phones and skip manual check-in. Airlines will just be notified when they've arrived at the airport via facial recognition scanners.

1.  According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Elon Musk is constantly scanning the horizon for new potential mothers for his children, using everything from X interactions and DMs to huge cash incentives to entice would-be incubators, whom he requires to sign legally binding payment agreements with nondisclosure clauses. As a result , Musk has an undisclosed number of children that is likely well above the 14 already publicly known , and he's shown no obvious intention to stop sowing his seed. Musk seems to have reduced traditional family relationships to mere financial arrangements, undermining longtime conservative agreement around the importance of family.

1.  Pope Francis, the Catholic church's first Latin American pope, has died at 88. He rose from a humble childhood in Argentina to become the leader of the world's largest and most powerful church. He was hospitalized in mid-February with bronchitis, which progressed to pneumonia in both lungs. The pope will be remembered for encouraging Catholics to embrace a more compassionate view on many issues, while finding it difficult to close the book on past abuses by clergy. On Sunday, he met with Vice President JD Vance and blessed thousands gathered in St. Peter's Square for Easter.

1.  F.B.I. agents arrested a Milwaukee county judge today on charges of obstructing immigration agents. They accused the judge, Hannah Dugan, of guiding an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while the agents waited to arrest him in a public hallway. The arrest was a major escalation in the Trump administration's battle with local authorities over deportations. President Trump and his top advisers have repeatedly assailed "local judges" and vowed to prosecute local officials who do not assist federal immigration enforcement efforts.

Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals, delivered : spirited and highly personal homily, AP reports. "He was a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone," Re said. "The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open." After the service concluded, a motorcade took Pope Francis's body through Rome to the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica for his final rest.

Young adults are increasingly taking health decisions into their own hands. 45% of adults ages 18-34 said they've disregarded their health provider's guidance in favor of information from a friend or family member in the past year — a 13-point increase from the previous year. The vast majority of young adults (82%) still said their doctor influences their health decisions. But one-third also reported that content creators without medical training had influenced health decisions.

A set of chemicals found in food packaging, plastics, and lotions and shampoos has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths from heart disease, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal eBioMedicine. These chemicals, known as phthalates, were responsible for more than 350,000 deaths worldwide in 2018, researchers found. About 75 percent of the deaths were in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific - reflecting growing concern about the amount of plastic proliferating in developing countries.

1.  Universal antivenom may grow out of a Wisconsin man From his home in Two Rivers, Wis., Tim Friede has been allowing venomous snakes to bite him — about 200 times over the years. Some venomous snake bites can kill a human within an hour, but Friede survives because, for 18 years, he has injected himself with carefully escalating doses of venom to build his immunity. Now, scientists say that his daredevilry could help to solve a dire global health problem. Venomous snakes kill at least 120,000 people a year, and research on Friede's blood might be able to be used to create an antivenom.

"The average American has, I think, it's fewer than three friends," Zuckerberg said during a podcast interview Monday. "And the average person has demand for meaningfully more." But where Zuckerberg sees opportunity, critics see alarm bells, especially given Meta's history and business model. "The more time you spend chatting with an Al 'friend,' the more of your personal information you're giving away," Robbie Torney, Common Sense Media's senior director of AI programs, told Axios. "It's about who owns and controls and can use your intimate thoughts and expressions after you share them."

island prison shut down in 1963 over high costs and failing infrastructure.
Alcatraz is currently a federally protected historic site run by the National
Park Service, which draws more than 1 million visitors a year as a major San
Francisco tourist attraction. "REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ," Trump
said, claiming it would detain the "most ruthless and violent Offenders" and
stand as a symbol of "Law, Order, and JUSTICE." The Bureau of Prisons said
it would begin an assessment, despite the island's lack of water, power, and
modern utilities.

The idea of "value investing" existed well before Warren Buffett began his
career. But no one did it as well, or for as long, as he did. In the process, Buffett,
94, built up a $168 billion fortune and influenced generations of investors,
promoting the now-common advice about investing for the long term. This
weekend, Buffett, who said "our favorite holding period is forever," announced
something that the finance world had been discussing for many years: the
"Oracle of Omaha" was stepping down and handing his $1.1 trillion
conglomerate to a new leader, Gregory Abel.
