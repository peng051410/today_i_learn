1, Judges rejected TikTok's effort to avoid a U.S. ban TikTok, a video app used by more than 170 million Americans, moved one step closer today to disappearing from the U.S. market. A panel of federal judges unanimously upheld a new law that requires the app's Chinese owner to either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner by mid-January or face a nationwide ban in the U.S. While Donald Trump has promised to save the app, the law is set to go into effect the day before his inauguration and it's unclear how he could evade an act of Congress and whether he wants to risk much political capital on this given his hawkish stance on China.

1.  Suspect in C.E.O. killing is fighting extradition

The 26-year-old man who was charged with murder in the assassination of a health insurance executive in Midtown Manhattan was denied bail today. Mangione saw himself as a hero fighting a corrupt health insurance industry, the authorities said in an internal report obtained by The Times. The police also expressed concern that the attack could inspire violence against similar executives or other extreme behavior. Here's what we know about the suspect: Mangione was a high school valedictorian and an Ivy League tech graduate from a prominent Maryland family. The subject of a missing-person report filed in San Francisco by his mother last month, he had stopped communicating with friends and family about six months ago.

Trump, speaking with Time, pledged to start pardoning Jan. 6 rioters once he enters office. He sounded open to banning some childhood vaccines and reversing protections for transgender kids. During the campaign, Trump said he'd lower grocery prices. Yesterday, he told Time that "it's hard to bring things down once they're up," but he added that he was still hopeful.

related deaths each year in the US, far more than the 13,500 alcohol-associated
annual traffic fatalities. Adding a cancer warning would highlight severe health
concerns for products that more than 70% of US adults consume at least once a
