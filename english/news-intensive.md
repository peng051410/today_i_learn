## One

1.  More than half of U.S. states have taken steps to ban or restrict cellphone use in K-12 schools. Even some students admit that their phones can be hugely disruptive during class, and cyberbullying is a persistent issue — but many parents see phones as critical safety tools in the event of a shooting or other emergency. In some schools, students are expected to put their devices in a secure pouch they can unlock when leaving for the day, or during an emergency.

## Two

1.  Shigeru Ishiba officially takes office as Japan's prime minister Tuesday, replacing Fumio Kishida, who resigned in no small part because of record-high disapproval numbers for their ruling Liberal Democratic Party. But this hardly heralds big change. Like Kishida, Ishiba is a second-generation LDP politician. And the LDP remains in power. The Liberal Democratic Party has ruled Japan for all but four of the past 69 years, leading some to ask whether its parliament is truly representative.

## Three

1.  China's stockmarket enjoyed its best day of trading since 2008, with its benchmark CSI300 surging over 8%, following nine days of consecutive gains. Investors were buoyed by the government's announcement of stimulus policies last week. The measures include cutting interest rates, trimming bank reserve requirements and lowering rates for existing mortgages.


## Four

1.  The stock market has been on a tear of late — up 34% over the past year and up 20% year-to-date. That's the best stock- market performance in the first three quarters since 1997, and it's boosted total returns over almost any time horizon. The index's 30-year return is 1,135% — it's risen more than twelvefold in the past three decades — and currently stands at an all-time high.
