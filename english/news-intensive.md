## One

1.  More than half of U.S. states have taken steps to ban or restrict cellphone use in K-12 schools. Even some students admit that their phones can be hugely disruptive during class, and cyberbullying is a persistent issue — but many parents see phones as critical safety tools in the event of a shooting or other emergency. In some schools, students are expected to put their devices in a secure pouch they can unlock when leaving for the day, or during an emergency.

## Two

1.  Shigeru Ishiba officially takes office as Japan's prime minister Tuesday, replacing Fumio Kishida, who resigned in no small part because of record-high disapproval numbers for their ruling Liberal Democratic Party. But this hardly heralds big change. Like Kishida, Ishiba is a second-generation LDP politician. And the LDP remains in power. The Liberal Democratic Party has ruled Japan for all but four of the past 69 years, leading some to ask whether its parliament is truly representative.

## Three

1.  China's stockmarket enjoyed its best day of trading since 2008, with its benchmark CSI300 surging over 8%, following nine days of consecutive gains. Investors were buoyed by the government's announcement of stimulus policies last week. The measures include cutting interest rates, trimming bank reserve requirements and lowering rates for existing mortgages.


## Four

1.  The stock market has been on a tear of late — up 34% over the past year and up 20% year-to-date. That's the best stock- market performance in the first three quarters since 1997, and it's boosted total returns over almost any time horizon. The index's 30-year return is 1,135% — it's risen more than twelvefold in the past three decades — and currently stands at an all-time high.

## One

1.  OpenAI just closed one of the largest fundraising rounds in history, valuing the company at $157 billion, a huge leap for a scrappy startup run by a handful of executives. But as OpenAl races to build a global business, it has been roiled by an exodus of top officials and much of the brain trust that put the startup on the map, including most recently Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. Employees at various levels of the company are now wrestling with exhaustion as concerns grow that OpenAl's initial commitment to responsible Al development may be wavering.

1.  Victor Rambros and Gary Ruvkin won the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine for their discovery of micro-RNA and "its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation". The Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, in Stockholm, which awards the prize, said that micro-RNAs are crucial "for how organisms develop and function". The American scientists will share a prize of 11m Swedish kronor ($1.06m).

1.  Melania Trump made an extraordinary declaration in an eagerly awaited memoir to be published a month from election day: she is a passionate supporter of a woman's right to control her own body- including the right to abortion. Melania Trump has rarely expressed political views in public. Her book, Melania, which reveals the former first lady to be so firmly out of step with most of her own party, will be published in the US next Tuesday.

## One

1.  Han Kang was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature

The Swedish Academy announced today that it had awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature to the South Korean author Han Kang. She is best known for her surreal, subversive novel "The Vegetarian," and she is the first writer from her country to receive the award. The prize's organizer said that Han received the honor "for her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life."

1.  The Nobel committee has put the spotlight back on global inequalities. Bestowing its prestigious economics prize on Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson is a reminder that income disparities among and within nations are just as important as climate change, the Al "revolution" and ageing societies. It is a much-needed wake-up call. The wealthiest 20% of the world's countries are now around 30 times richer than the poorest 20%, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted. And the gap is persisting even though poor countries have become richer.

1.  Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved a significant milestone on Sunday by catching the massive booster stage from its Starship rocket in a pair of robotic arms as it fell back to the company's launchpad in southern Texas. It is the first time SpaceX has attempted the bold manoeuvre, one it sees as crucial to its goal of developing fully reusable rockets capable of ferrying humans, scientific equipment and supplies to the moon and onwards to Mars.

4, Rafael Nadal, the 38-year-old Spanish tennis legend, released a video today to announce that he would retire after next month's Davis Cup. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Nadal won 22 Grand Slam titles and was by far the most dominant clay-court player ever.
